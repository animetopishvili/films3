        While The Chronicles of Narnia series as a whole is recognized as a
        classic of children's literature, the series won surprisingly few awards
        on its initial publication. The only novel in the series to win any
        award was The Last Battle, the seventh and final book of the series.

      <p>
        Prince Caspian features a "return to Narnia" by the four Pevensie
        children of the first novel, about a year later in England but 1300
        years later in Narnia. It is the only book of The Chronicles with men
        dominating Narnia. The talking animals and mythical beings are
        oppressed, and some may be endangered.
